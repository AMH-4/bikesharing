## Summary:

The results from the above graphs show the active usage of Citi Bikes in NYC. From each visualization, investors can gain a better understanding of who the target market is, and how they will utilize the services in Des Moines. While Citi Bikes are used in residential areas, there is a cluster of higher usage in tourist/business districts.  The target customer is a male subscriber who bikes for less than 30min. during the week. The best time for bikes to be serviced for repairs would be between the early hours of 1:00 - 3:00AM. 

Additiaonal data analysis should be performed to further understand the cost of business. Visualizations such as determining bike utilization on NYC 2,344,224 trips and convergence of customer type. As additional data is visualized, the investors will have a compelling story matched with enthusiasm to bring bike sharing to Des Moines.
